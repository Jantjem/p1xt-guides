### Day 0: Sept 10, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Followed along with Khan Academy Intro to JS 

**Thoughts:** I remember a little bit about functions from the time I tried FreeCodeCamp. It feels good to start the P1xt guides.
I'll also read this article today. A recommendation by Barb (Learning How to Learn newsletter): https://medium.com/better-humans/how-to-read-academic-content-once-and-remember-it-forever-e44f26d82566

### Day 1: Sept 11, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Followed along with Khan Academy Intro to JS 

**Thoughts:** I learned about if/else statements. I wish I could go faster and create something, but I want to build a good foundation, so I will carry on with the basics.

### Day 2: Sept 12, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Followed along with Khan Academy Intro to JS 

**Thoughts:** I learned about While loops, using the following questions:

/* Three Loop questions:
 1. What do I want to repeat? 
   -> The text function with the message!
 2. What do I want to change each time? 
   -> The y position, increasing by 20 each time.
 3. How long should we repeat?
   -> As long as y is less than 400, all the way down.
